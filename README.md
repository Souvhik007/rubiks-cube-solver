# Rubik's Cube Solver 🧩

This project is a **Rubik's Cube simulator and visual solver**, built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for an internship assignment. It allows you to scramble a Rubik’s Cube into a zigzag color pattern and solve it instantly back to its original state.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎨 **Visual Cube Rendering** – Shows the cube as a 2D color grid.
- 🔀 **Scramble Button** – Randomizes each face's colors for visual shuffling.
- ✅ **Solve Button** – Restores the cube to a solved state.
- ♻️ **Responsive & Lightweight** – Runs fully in the browser, no backend required.

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## 🧠 How It Works

- The cube is represented as an object with 6 faces (`U, R, F, D, L, B`).
- Each face is an array of 9 elements representing tiles.
- Scrambling randomizes the color of each tile.
- Solving resets the cube back to its default color order.

### 📝 Note

This is a simplified version of a Rubik’s Cube solver. It focuses on **visual behavior and logic**, not cube physics or optimal algorithmic solving.
